# Turknet Counter

### What Is This?

I started learning React, Vite and Tailwind a couple days ago.
However, there was a problem. I needed fun and very simple project ideas.

This ISP called [turknet](https://turk.net) was keeping me on hold for a week to setup
a VDSL connection and I thought, how about a counter that counts how much time passed since
turknet keeps me waiting.

### Learning Outcomes

- The concept of React
- Functional React components
- State and effect
  - Using State and Effect hooks
  - Concept of a "side effect"
